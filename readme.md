# âš¡ Examples for `batteries`

A collection of example usage scripts for [batteries](https://github.com/1bardesign/batteries).

Kept separate from the main `batteries` repo to avoid cluttering the commit history and bloating the repo size.

Will contain along with a [love](https://love2d.org)-compatible `main.lua` which allows browsing them interactively.

# Index of Examples

- `functional.lua` - a walkthrough of the functional programming facilities provided by `functional` module.

# TODO

- `table.lua` - a run through the table api extensions
- `math.lua` - demo of the math api extensions
- `colour.lua` - using hex colours in love; hsv once it exists :)
- `sequence.lua` - demonstrates the shorter, more sequential code afforded by `sequence`
- `2d_geom.lua` - basic colliding and overlapping entities using `intersect` and `vec2`; requires love for visualisation.

# Contributing

**This repo is currently being formed and contribution is not yet recommended.**

Pull Requests with new demos will be welcome, though it will be required that they work with the rest of the example framework.

Fixes and enhancements to existing demos are also great and will generally be merged optimistically.
