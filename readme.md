# âš¡ Examples for `batteries`

A collection of example usage scripts for [batteries](https://github.com/1bardesign/batteries).

Kept separate from the main `batteries` repo to avoid cluttering the commit history and bloating the repo size.

Comes with a [love](https://love2d.org)-compatible `main.lua` which allows browsing the source and output interactively.

# Index of Examples

- `functional.lua` - a walkthrough of the functional programming facilities provided by `functional` module.
- `math.lua` - demo of the math api extensions.

# TODO

- `table.lua` - a run through the table api extensions.
- `sequence.lua` - demonstrates the shorter, more sequential code afforded by `sequence`.
- `2d_geom.lua` - basic colliding and overlapping entities using `intersect` and `vec2`; requires love.
- `state_boring.lua` - barebones state machine example.
- `state_ai.lua` - visualised state machine ai for a sparring partner; requires love.
- `stable_sort.lua` - show the benefit of a stable sort for sprite z sorting.
- `colour.lua` - using hex colours in love; hsv once it exists :)
- `benchmark.lua` - benchmark various functionality interactively.

# Contributing

**This repo is currently being formed and contribution is not _yet_ recommended. Keep your eyes peeled! ðŸ‘€**

Pull Requests with new demos will be welcome, though it will be required that they work with the rest of the example framework.

Fixes and enhancements to existing demos are also great and will generally be merged optimistically.
